# Pytorch_project
So, Pytorch is basically a framework for machine learning and deep learning. It helpes by taking care of all GPU acceleration.
Before we understand about pytorch, let's learn about Tensors.
#TENSORS: can be a simple scalar(0-dimensional tensor), an array(1-D Tesnor), a matrix(2D T) or a multi-dimensional matrix(nD T). 
But Tensors apart from storing data and weigths and biases but are also designed for hardwae acceleration(GPU) so that neural networks can do all the math that are do in relatively short period of time.
